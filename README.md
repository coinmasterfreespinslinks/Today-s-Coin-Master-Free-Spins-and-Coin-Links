### Understanding Coin Masterâ€™s Gameplay: What Are Spins and Coins Used For?

In Coin Master, spins and coins are essential to progress through the game. Here's how you use them:

#### Spins

Spins are the core mechanic of the game. They allow you to spin the slot machine to win different rewards, including:

- **Coins:** The primary in-game currency, used to build villages, buy chests, and upgrade your base.
- **Attacks:** A special action that allows you to raid other players and steal their coins.
- **Raids:** This lets you attack other playersâ€™ villages to earn coins and items.
- **Pets:** Pets give you special bonuses during attacks and raids, helping you win more rewards.

Each time you spin, you may get one of these rewards. Spins are limited, but with enough free spins, you can keep spinning as much as you like.

#### Coins

Coins are required to:

- **Build Villages:** Each time you complete a village, you unlock a new one, with more challenging tasks ahead.
- **Buy Chests:** Chests contain valuable items and cards to help you progress further in the game.
- **Upgrade Pets:** Pets can be upgraded to increase their effectiveness during raids and attacks.

Coins are just as essential as spins, and they are hard to come by unless youâ€™re earning them through spins, attacks, or raids. This is where the free spin and coin links come in handy!

### Best Practices for Using Free Spins and Coins

Now that you know how to get free spins and coins, here are some tips for maximizing their value:

#### 1. **Spin Wisely**

You may be tempted to use all your spins in one go, but it's best to pace yourself. Plan your spins according to the events or goals you are focusing on. For example, if there's a raid event, prioritize spins that give you the "raid" feature.

#### 2. **Build Your Village Strategically**

Before spending coins to build your village, check to see if you can earn the necessary items from chests or other players. Some villages require specific cards, so itâ€™s important to keep an eye on which cards you need to complete your collection.

#### 3. **Use Pets Effectively**

Pets can make or break your raids and attacks. Level them up with your coins to maximize their effectiveness, especially when they give you extra spins, shields, or other boosts.

#### 4. **Join a Coin Master Team**

Joining a team can greatly increase your chances of getting free spins and coins. Teams share rewards, help each other with raids, and participate in special team events. Working together as a team can lead to more rewards than going solo.

#### 5. **Save Spins for Special Events**

Coin Master often has special events where you can earn more rewards for completing challenges. During these events, spins and coins become even more valuable. Save your spins for these times to make the most out of your rewards.
